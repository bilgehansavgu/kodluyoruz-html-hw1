                        What is so admirable is that they recognize the need of a master and of instruction in all other affairs and study them with some care. It is only the science of life which they do not study at all, and which they do not desire to comprehend. NICOLET reatise on the Necessity of Not Trusting to Chance. IN the seventeenth century and during a part of the eighteenth, religion held supreme sway over the mind: the problem of the education of the will could not present itself in all its generalities. The forces wielded by the Catholic Church, that incomparable mistress of character, were sufficient to regulate along its broader lines the life of the believer. But to-day this instruction has been eliminated by the majority of thinking men, and it has never been replaced.
